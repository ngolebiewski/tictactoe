# Tic Tac Toe
## Learning about Divs and Spans
### One day...soon...program a tic tac toe game!

Interesting things I learned:
- Flex display keeping the board centered in the browser because width is not specified for section in CSS
- There's a "fantasy" font-family style and it looks terrible!!!! But, I think if I make a text-based RPG I'll have to use it for scrolls etc.

Stretch Goal (aka __scope creep__)
- css draw a sheet of loose leaf paper for the tic tac toe grid to go on, with 3 holes, blue rule lines, and that red margin line.
